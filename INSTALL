	Darkbot, Talking Robot - Copyright (c) 2003 Darkbot Project

	Welcome to the Darkbot install file. This will be a step by step guide to 
	installing your Darkbot, so read it all, before you do anything. 

	If you have not read this file and come into the help channel on the  Darkbot
	Network, we will know, and it might mean you will be helped last. 

	With that out of the way, if you have done every thing in this file and still 
	can not get your Darkbot running, feel free to join #Darkbot on the Darkbot
	Network, and we will do our best to help you.  Keep in mind that we are not 
	there to set up and run your bot for you.  One or two questions about commands 
	are okay, but if you have to ask about every command, then maybe you shouldn't 
	be running a bot. 

	Note: There are many builds of Linux out in the world today. The coders try and 
	build Darkbot to be run on as many as possible but some times it doesn't work 
	out that way.  If there is a problem with compiling Darkbot on your Linux build,
	please let us know. 

	Help can be found for Darkbot either by irc, or from our web page. 

	Irc: Servers irc.darkbot.org, eu.undernet.org, us.undernet.org

	We do not support any Darkbot code that has been downloaded from any site other 
	then the official one.  Any code that has been modified by anyone other than an 
	official Darkbot coder, will also not be supported. (If you have a good idea 
	for a modification, please share it with us. If it makes the final code, you 
	will be given credit.)

	###############################################################

	Follow the order of events described here, and you'll have your Darkbot up and 
	running!

	DOWNLOAD
	Download to your shell compressed archive from
	http://www.darkbot.org/downloads.html

	INSTALLATION 
	De-compress the downloaded archive (tar -zxvf *.tar.gz)

	tar -zxvf darkbot-6f6.tar.gz

	- Change to the newly created directory

	Note: For older Darkbots, this dir will be (darkbot6f6), for new or beta builds,
	it will be (darkbot)

	cd darkbot6f6 or cd darkbot

	BASIC CONFIGURATION

	Starting configuration process. 
	./configure

	You do need to run ./configure - Darkbot does not build itself into your system 
	without that step. 
	We are not going into detail and repeating the instructions shown when you run 
	./configure, because they are self-explanatory. 
	Most of the doubts and frequently asked questions on that, only rely on Linux, 
	and not Darkbot matters. For instance, the default text editor is pico, but you 
	can use any other text-mode editor that comes with your distribution, like vi, 
	less, Emacs, XEmacs, NEdit or others. "That stripping thing" on the end of 
	compilation process - it shrinks a little bit the size of the executable, and 
	some extra and non necessary codes are removed; makes no difference on Darkbot's 
	performance, so do whatever you want with it.

	At any point during the configuration process you can abort (by pressing CTRL + 
	C or other way your system or editor allows) and start again. 
	If for some reason you have an error and the compilation process is not 
	completed, correct the error and after saving your changes type 'make'. 
	If you want to run Darkbot after answering 'no' to run on the end of 
	compilation process just type './darkbot'.

	Have this in mind: Darkbot should work if you follow ./configure instructions. 
	So, if isn't working, try again and read those carefully.
	If you want to personalize more or change specific items to your Darkbot after 
	./configure you have two choices: run 'configure' again or you can edit the 
	files. All files on darkbot\dat\ are offline hand editable and all have basic 
	syntax examples in it. Do not leave empty lines and disconnect your Darkbot from 
	IRC before editing configuration files.

	OFFLINE CONFIGURATION SETTINGS 
	(follow the samples in the files and don't leave any empty lines)
	How to do it.

	[userlist.db] 
	Adding users to Darkbot's user list.
	Open darkbot\dat\userlist.db and check this sample line: '#* 
	*user@*.yourhostmask.com 3 0 mypass I need to use SETINFO' with your 
	information.

	#* = (with asterisk) adds user to all channels; #channel1 adds user to channel1 
	*user@*.yourhostmask.com = is the mask of the user to add 

	3 = user level -- You should always be Darkbot's administrator (level 3) on your 
	darkbot\dat\userlist.db [Level 3 is the highest, allows you to control all 
	Darkbot functions; level 2 gives access to channel operation commands plus level 
	1 commands; level 1 only permits to manage Darkbot's database - it's the so 
	called helper level; all other commands are public, meaning everyone can perform 
	them].

	0 = number of times Darkbot saw that user on the default channel 

	mypass = If you want to define a password for you can do it replacing 'mypass' 
	with user's one. 

	'I need to use SETINFO' = is a message Darkbot sends to newly registered users 
	in order to remind them to define or not it's greeting message. Leave it as is 
	or write, for example, "Hi Boss ;)". You can also replace 'setinfo' message with 
	a 0 (zero) to disable it. 

	(You can add more users from online with the !adduser command or delete with the 
	!deluser command) 

	[setup.ini]
	Open darkbot\dat\setup.ini.
	This is the file you need to edit to setup your Darkbot's nickname, username, 
	realname, default channel to join, virtual host, command character prefix and 
	seen users switch. Change the contents of the file as you need overwriting 
	existing parameters. Do not remove anything before '='. Do not leave extra 
	spaces or lines. Do not use carriage returns. Save and exit.

	Obs.:
	'VHOST= ' to set your virtual host (must be a registered domain pointed to the 
	same computer as Darkbot and configured for IRC)

	'CHAN=#ChannelHere' sets Darkbot's default channel. If you want to add 
	more channels use perform.ini.

	'CMDCHAR= ' to set Darkbot's command prefix to trigger most of it's commands.

	'NICK='This is the nick your bot will have when it joins irc, default is Darkbot

	'USERID='This will be the name before the @ in the bots user host

	'REALNAME=' This will be the info after your bots user host

	'AUTOTOPIC='Automatically cycles channel's topic every 30 minutes. To turn 
	autotopic off, use "0" (zero) in place of the topic.

	'SEEN='Turns  seen  on  or off. 1= on, 0= off

	[perform.ini] 
	Having Darkbot performing IRC commands automatically.
	You can make Darkbot perform a list of raw IRC commands when it connects to the 
	server (as mIRC's perform function). You can make your Darkbot join other 
	channels, perform mode changes, login to channel services with it. Depending on 
	each network, your IRC knowledge and your imagination depends the commands you can 
        add.
	Open and edit darkbot\dat\perform.ini. Write one command per line.

	Examples:
	- to join an additional channel besides default one
	JOIN #Channel_here

	- to set modes
	MODE #Channel +nt

	- to set a topic as soon as enters a channel
	TOPIC #Channel_here :this is a test topic

	- to send a message to you as soon as it connects
	PRIVMSG YourNick :hey... I'm here

	- to send a notice to you
	NOTICE YourNick :be ready to feed me :p

	- to authenticate on Superchat.org
	PRIVMSG serv@superchat.org :login #darkbot blahblah

	- to authenticate on Undernet's CService
	PRIVMSG x@channels.undernet.org :login username password

	- to have bot X giving op to your Darkbot
	PRIVMSG X :op #channel_here username

	- to login and get Ops on a eggdrop
	PRIVMSG Eggdrop_nick :op password #channel

	General rule to send raw IRC messages is preceding the message with ':'. However 
	there are situations where you might be able to perform commands without it.

	- to identity your Darkbot on some servers
	NICKSERV IDENTIFY darkbot_password

	- for some channel services
	CHANSERV OP #channel_here Darkbot

	[deop.ini] 
	Changing Darkbot's behavior when is not Op.
	You can have your Darkbot perform commands when it loses channel Op like messaging 
	you, automatically asking Op to the channel service or another bot or Ops. Open 
	and edit darkbot\dat\deop.ini. Check the examples below. Leave this file blank 
	if you want it to do nothing. (see also examples used on perform.ini)

	PRIVMSG #channel_here :Hmm, wish I had ops...

	NOTICE Your_nick : I lost Ops :(

	PRIVMSG x@channels.undernet.org :login username password

	PRIVMSG X :op username

	PRIVMSG serv@superchat.org :login #darkbot blahblah

	chanserv op #channel_here Darkbot

	PRIVMSG Eggdrop_nick :op password #channel

	[servers.ini] 
	Changing or adding servers to Darkbot.
	By default Darkbot connects to one of UnderNets servers
	us.undernet.org 6667
	eu.undernet.org 6667

	Open and edit darkbot\dat\servers.ini. You can list as many servers as you want, 
	so if it's disconnected, it'll switch to others. Do not leave empty lines. Do 
	not mix servers, like us.undernet.org and dal.net. Save and exit.

	GOING ONLINE

	Write on your shell './darkbot' in order to have it connect to the Internet.
	Wait a little bit and if you didn't change servers.ini in order to use another 
	network, Darkbot will join channel #Darkbot at Undernet.org. (To join this 
	network type in your IRC client /server us.undernet.org and /join #darkbot)
	If you did change the servers.ini and the CHAN= in the setup.ini then Darkbot 
	will join that server and channel that you set there. 
	If another nick Darkbot is already there, your Darkbot will take nick Darkbot0, 
	Darkbot1 etc. (You can see which one is yours by doing /whois and looking at the 
	output info. It will have the same hostmask as yours or the machine where it is 
	running).

	You can have Darkbot jump to another server by performing !JUMP command.

	Setting or changing the password to access Darkbot (25 characters maximum). If 
	you didn't change 'mypass' on userlist.db write
	/msg Darkbot pass mypass my_new_pass.

	After changing it you'll receive a notice like this:
	-- Password for youruserid@yourhostmask.com has been updated.

	Login to Darkbot:
	Now you have to authenticate yourself to Darkbot to perform some commands. To do 
	so type
	/msg Darkbot LOGIN YourPass
	You'll receive a notice like this from Darkbot:
	-- Verified: #darkbot[3]

	Notes: have in mind - for security reasons - if you or Darkbot leaves the channel 
	you have to login again when returning.

	ONLINE ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION SETTINGS

	Set greeting message

	If you want Darkbot to greet you when you join the channel and you didn't 
	already edit it in the userlist.db 'I need to use SETINFO' type, for example,
	!SETINFO I think I know you ;P

	(!setinfo 0 disables the function; typing !setinfo without any parameters gives 
	you some help about the command)
	Next time you join the channel Darkbot will greet you with that mesage.

	Set Darkbot's nick name
	In order to have Darkbot with a nick you like, you only need to type,
	!SETNICK MyDarkbot

	Set userid
	If you want to change Darkbot's user id type,
	!SETUSER newuserid

	Set default channel
	To instruct Darkbot what channel must be the default one, type,
	!SETCHAN #YourChannel

	Set Command Character
	If you want to change the default command prefix [ ! ] issued to Darkbot to 
	execute some commands and, for instance, you want to use command character '>' 
	type,
	!SETCHAR > 

	Set auto topic
	Auto-topic function makes Darkbot repeat channel's topic you specify every 30 
	seconds (default). To do so type, for example,
	!AUTOTOPIC Visit http://www.darkbot.org for complete Darkbot information.

	Set virtual host
	If you want to set a virtual host to Darkbot type (must be a registered domain 
	pointed to the same computer as Darkbot and configured for IRC)
	!VHOST your.vhost.com

	--**-- 
	The remaining files within the \dat folder can also been edited offline. info2.db 
	(stores topics and corresponding replies), randomstuff.ini (stores random 
	replies), seen.db (stores the list of users seen by Darkbot) and perbans.db 
	(stores permanent bans)

	START ADDING TOPICS 

	As all commands in this document YOU MUST LOGIN (/msg BotNick LOGIN yourpass) 
	before you can execute any Darkbot's command)! Also, you need to read the complete 
	command list document where you find a more detailed explanation about each one.
	This is only a superficial help file to get you to add, modify and delete basic 
        topic replies.

	Login to your Darkbot
	Type:
	YourBotNick ADD hello hello N~
	(now type 'hello' and Darkbot will reply 'Hello YourNick')

	Type:
	YourBotNick MODIFY hello Hi N~, thanks for coming to C~ 
	(now type 'hello' and the Darkbot's reply was modified to 'Hello YourNick, 
	thanks for coming to #YourChannel')

	Type:
	YourBotNick DELETE hello
	(Darkbot deletes the topic 'hello'. If you type hello he don't answer)

	YOU MUST READ

	Darkbots Commands List and all help documents. This is only a short 
	file to get your Darkbot up and running. 
	------------------ " -------------------

	OTHER FILES

	info2.db - This is the information your darkbot learns and replys to when asked 
	questions. It's the main database.
	A topic can be more than one word, but will be separated with +'s instead of 
	spaces. If a data starts with a +, the reply will be in the form of an action. 
	If the data starts with a -, the output can be stacked using PIPES and you can 
	use raw data, to do things such as NOTICE, PRIVMSG and even KICK. The symbol "^" 
	is the $nickname variable. The ^R (reverse control char) is the $chan variable. 
	While this may seem a bit confusing... don't worry about it, It's very simple, 
	just hard to explain in words without SHOWING you the bot in action.

	randomstuff.ini - List of random things to say. You can add more online by 
	saying: BotNick RANDOMSTUFF information to add.

	permbans.db - This is a text file, just a .db (database) file name extension. 
	Use the !PERMBAN and !DELBAN commands from on-line to add\delete.

	seen.db - This is a list of people your bot has seen. You can access it with 
	!SEEN , seen's over one week old are deleted.

	SOMETHING WRONG
	All suggestions here are proved to work on several linux flavors and several 
	machines. Although we believe there are no side effects to your computer or to 
	yourself in doing it, follow them at your own risk. Do not blame your Darkbot in 
	case he decides not answering you.

	(A) - Before proceed:
	- Turn off your Darkbot by issuing command 'kill' (do ps x to see Darkbot's 
	process id and kill -9 pidNumber or killall darkbot)

	(B) - Always make a backup of the file you want to work with before any change 
	or make a copy of Darkbot's folder using command 'cp'. Leave the file or 'Copy 
	of darkbot' as a safe backup in case you need to restore a file, you already have 
        it.

	(C) - Use linux text editors if you can to edit Darkbot files. If you can't use 
	another text editor; the one you are using might be adding hidden codes or 
	changing the format of the original files. Check if file extension is the same. 
	For instance, if you are using Windows Notepad and file userlist.db extension 
	after editing and saving is userlist.db.txt rename it to userlist.db.

	(D) - Do not leave empty lines on the middle of others or on the end of the 
	text.

	============================

	A Few F.A.Q's

	I can't read and edit some files that have kind of strange black squares. Is 
	that Code Black virus? 
	-Darkbot is done in a way that is very safe in all aspects not only on IRC but 
	also on it's invulnerability to virus or trojans. So no, it's not any virus or 
	nothing like that. Those are codes left by your editor when tabs and carriage 
	returns are used. Looks like you are editing those files in Windows so use 
	Wordpad. You can also use Notepad but in some files you need to reconstruct the 
	lines in a way of having each command line on a separated line. Never leave 
	empty lines.

	My Darkbot don't connect at all.

	- Run Darkbot with minimal configuration (no hand editing at all) to see if 
	connects to Undernet.org and goes to channel #darkbot. If you go there, Darkbot 
	should react with a short answer if you write it's nick.

	- if not, install Darkbot again from the original compressed file. If problem 
	persists your original compressed Darkbot file or some of it's contents might be 
	corrupted so download it again from Darkbot's official site.

	My Darkbot don't recognizes me when I /msg Darkbot login mypassword.

	- After following procedures on (A) add yourself to darkbot\dat\userlist.db - 
	Save and exit - Connect Darkbot again and try to /msg Darkbot login 
	yourpassword.

	- if Darkbot notices you as accepting your login, write on the public window 
	'Darkbot add test 123'. Darkbot should answer 'Okay'. Write 'test'. Darkbot 
	should answer '123'.

	- if not, follow procedures on A, B, C and D.

	- if Darkbot is still not accepting your login 
	- Open your darkbot\dat\userlist.db
	On the sample line '*user@*.yourhostmask.com 3 0 mypass I need to use SETINFO' 
	You only need to overwrite *user@*.yourhostmask.com and 'mypass' in order to get 
	your Darkbot online and access to it.
	The mask *user@*.yourhostmask.com should match the one you have when you connect 
	to the same network where your Darkbot is (do /whois to_ yournick to compare 
	it). You must use a wildcard * on all portions of the mask that change in every 
	time you connect. General concept is you should substitute all changing items on 
	your mask with an asterisk (*).

	- While connected do /whois YourNickHere and check the first line of the output. 

	On the userid/ident side (the one on the left of @) you must use one * right 
	before of it on your userlist.db entry. If that ident has a leading ~ don't use 
	it. ~myident@blah.blah.blah or myident@blah.blah.blah should go to userlist as 
	*myident@blah.blah.blah. If your ident changes at times (some characters are 
	missing like this ~myid@blah.blah.blah) on the right side, right before @, use 
	the wildcard on both ends, i.e., *myid*@blah.blah.blah.
	On the IP address side, right of @, compare what you have with the examples 
	bellow.

	Static IPs (never changes):

	- if your IP looks like this: myident@myhost123.mydomain.com 
	you shoud add as *myident@myhost123.mydomain.com

	- if your IP looks like this: myident@11.222.12.123 
	you should add as *myident@11.222.12.123

	Dynamic IPs (changes with each connection):

	- if your IP looks like this: myident@myhost123.mydomain.com and the portion 
	that changes for every connection is '123'
	you'll add *myident@myhost*.mydomain.com

	- if your IP looks like this: myident@11.222.12.123 if the portion that changes 
	for every connection is 12.123 you'll add *myident@11.222.*

	My Darkbot don't connect to the servers I want. 
	Write on darkbot/scripts directory ./AddServer and follow instructions
	or
	- follow procedures on A, B, C and D.

	- open servers.ini and remove the servers in there adding those you would like 
	Darkbot to connect to. Syntax must be .irc.server.here 6667' and NOT 
	irc.server.here:6667' . Save and connect.

	My Darkbot is not giving me the greeting message (setinfo). 
	Darkbot ignores whoever rejoins a channel for a period of time. The default 
	length of time to not recount someone when rejoins the channel is set to 60 
	seconds.

	My Darkbot is not accepting commands if I repeat them in a short period of time. 

	Darkbot ignores for a certain period of time repeated commands to avoid 
	flooding. Use one command alias or wait a couple minutes.

	My Darkbot is not answering when someone asks the same question. 
	Darkbot will not reply to a topic already asked (with same syntax) during a 
	certain period. By default that length of time is set to 5 seconds.

	I'm stuck... I don't know how to turn off my Darkbot 
	You can use command !die online or on your shell kill -9 pidNumber after doing 
	'ps x' do check it's pid, or killall darkbot.
