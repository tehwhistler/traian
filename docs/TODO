The TO-DO List For Darkbot
----------------------------------------------------------
These are features that are in the planning stages, or 
that haven't been completely worked out, yet.  Also, any
suggestions that people have made, that are planning to 
be added, will be listed here.
----------------------------------------------------------

- Finish the autoconf/automake scripts that I started on.

- Add some kind of escape sequence or special parsing 
  for topics that start with key words like "WHAT", these
  words are also recognized internally by the bot for 
  answering questions.  

- chansrv.c badly needs to be revamped. needs a command
  structure that allows easy modification and addition,
  without the massive if-else-elseif structure it has
  currently.

- Multi-channel randomstuffs. I want to make it possible 
  for every channel specified in setup.ini as the home 
  channel, in the case of multiple home channels, has
  their own randomstuff timers that output randomstuffs
  according to the action going on, for each specific 
  channel.
